# Java_X_O_Console-Application-
A Java-based console implementation of the classic Tic-Tac-Toe game using an n*n matrix. The game allows two players to take turns marking their moves on a customizable grid size, with the winner being the first to align their marks in a row, column, or diagonal. The application demonstrates (OOP) concepts and handles game logic dynamically.
